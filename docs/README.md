# Documentation

Start with the guide for the task at hand. The JSON files in [schemas](../schemas/README.md)
define the current record contracts; historical designs do not override them.

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Package foundation](package-foundation.md) | Implemented storage API, validation CLI, integrity checks and limits. |
| [Schema usage](schema-usage-guide.md) | How producers populate the eight current record types. |
| [Schema compatibility](schema-compatibility.md) | Differences between 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 and future migration requirements. |
| [Verification and execution contract](verification-contract.md) | Evidence requirements, verdict rules, adapter boundaries and paired execution. |

Storage and package validation are implemented. Automated intake, builders,
execution and the CVE-specific oracle are not implied by valid package records.
Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for repository rules and
[test instructions](../tests/schema/README.md) for Docker-only checks.

## Historical design material

The [archive](archive/README.md) preserves the comprehensive schema plan,
field design and consistency review. Consult it for earlier reasoning or deferred
requirements, not instructions for current producers. Repeated MVP field lists
were removed from the old proposal; use the usage guide and versioned schemas.
